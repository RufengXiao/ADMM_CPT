## Description
The goal of this software is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADMM method proposed in this paper in the problem of decision making under cumulative prospect theory, as compared to other methods, as well as the effectiveness of the model when applied to empirical study.

## Data

## Results

The results are presented in the numerical experiments section of the paper. 

The folder `results` contains the raw results files, with the contents and descriptions as follows:
* `daily_pic`: the files within this folder contain the results of the empirical studies referenced in Appendix D of the paper, organized as follows:
  * `CumulativeReturnSumdaily.eps`: Figure 1 in the paper illustrates the cumulative returns of the seven portfolios.
  * `SSPW*daily.eps`: Figure 3 in the paper is box-plots of six optimal portfolios’ diversification degrees.  `*` can be 2,3,4,5 or 6.
  * `Top5AverageWeightsfor*daily.eps`: Figure 2 in the paper is average weights on five top and other assets. `*` can be 'benchmark', 'largereferencepoint', 'nolossaversion', 'noprobabilitydistorition', 'noriskaversionandriskseeking', 'riskfreereferencepoint'.
  * `stats_daily.xlsx`: Table 6 in the paper  illustrates several performance metrics of the seven portfolios based on the 1000 different realizations.
* `res_w`: the files within this folder contain the solution of the the optimization problem under the settings of Section 5.3 in the paper solving by the ADMM-PAV in the paper, organized as follows:
  * `w_daily_used_*.mat`: `xopt` in this file denotes the solution based on the *FF48 dataset* in the paper. `*` can be 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 represents utilizing historical returns data for the first `*` days as scenarios for the optimization problem.
  * `w_SP500_2_*.mat`: `xopt` in this file denotes the solution based on the *S&P 500 dataset* in the paper. `*` can be 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 and represents utilizing historical returns data for the first `*` days as scenarios for the optimization problem.
* `5-1_subproblemtest.mat`: the variables `dp_time`, `dp_val`, `fmincon_time`, `fmincon_val`, `pav_time`, and `pav_val` in the document represent the raw results corresponding to each respective time and objective value in Table 1 of Section 5.1 in the paper. Each variable is a matrix where rows denote Scenarios and columns denote instances.
* `5-2_ADMM_x_m*.mat`: the results under the settings in Section 5.3 in the paper by ADMM.
`x` can be either 48 or 500; 48 indicates that the problem is based on the *FF48 dataset*, while 500 signifies that the problem is based on the *S&P 500 dataset*. `m` can be either 'DP' or 'PAV', indicating that the $y$-subproblem was solved using either the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm or the pooling-adjacent-violators (PAV) algorithm described in Section 4.  `*` may denote '_rf' or be absent. If present as '_rf', it indicates that the reference point $B=r_f$, corresponding to the results presented in Table 3 of Section 5.2 in the paper. Conversely, if `*` is not present, it signifies that the reference point $B=0$, which aligns with the results documented in Table 2 of the same section. The variables stored are described as follows:
  * `flags`: indicates whether ADMM_PAV has converged under different scenarios.
  * `objvalue`: denotes the objective value under different scenarios.
  * `srs`: each column represents the results of the objective value under different scenarios as it changes with the number of iterations.
  * `times`: the ADMM run times under different scenarios.

* `5-3_fmincon_*.mat`: the results under the settings in Section 5.3 in the paper by the **fmincon** solver in **MATLAB**. `*` can denote either 'daily_used' or 'SP500_2', representing which dataset the optimization problem is based upon. The variables stored are similar to `5-2_fmincon_x*.mat`.

* `*_cptopt_results.mat`: the results under the settings in Section 5.3 in the paper by the other method. `*` can denote either 'daily_used' or 'SP500_2', representing which dataset the optimization problem is based upon. The variables stored are described as follows:
  * `ccob`, `cctime`: the objetive value and time  under the settings in Section 5.3 in the paper by the iterated convex-concave (CC) method.
